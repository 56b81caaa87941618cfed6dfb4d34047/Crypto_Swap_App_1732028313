The AI then posed two sets of questions regarding the specific fields to include in the form and its styling options. In the first set, the options were to include fields for the amount and currency type or to add a recipient address. In the second set, the user was asked how they would like the form styled, with choices for minimalist versus colorful and engaging designs. The user responded affirmatively to the implementation of a crypto swapping form. The user was also offered a checklist of additional features to consider, including a user-friendly dropdown for selecting cryptocurrencies and an exchange rate calculator, which the user indicated would be included. The AI later sought further details by asking the user to describe the project more thoroughly.\nUser: add a form\nUser: add a form\nAI: Sure, I will start working on adding a form now.\nAI: Okay, I'll begin working on adding the form now.\nUser: add a form\n\nThis is the user's current request of changes to be made:\nadd a form"
