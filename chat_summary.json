The user was subsequently presented with a checklist of additional features for the form, which included options such as user-friendly input validation, real-time exchange rate display, transaction summaries, responsive design, and success/error message pop-ups. Some features were marked as checked (e.g., confirmation modal after submission, user-friendly dropdown for selecting cryptocurrencies, and exchange rate calculator), while others were not yet implemented.\n\nAdditionally, the user answered questions about specific fields to include in the form (e.g., amount, currency selection) and preferences for styling (e.g., modern or minimalist design). The AI continued to request clarification on the project and provided options for further customization related to the form's design and functionality. Overall, the conversation highlighted a collaborative effort between the user and the AI to create a comprehensive and user-friendly crypto swapping form.",
